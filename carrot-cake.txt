Carrot cake

I usually do this cake in a round baking form with a diameter of about 24 cm. In Parum I multiplied the amount of the ingredients by two but this is the so called original version.

Dough:
2 dl sugar
2 eggs
1 dl oil
3 dl grated carrots

2 dl wheat flour
1 teaspoon (ts) of baking powder
1 ts soda
1 ts cinnamon 

Glaze:
100 g cream cheese (like Philadelphia)
60 g melted butter
2,5-3 dl powder sugar
2 ts vanilla sugar

Whisk the sugar with eggs, add the oil and grated carrot. Mix flour with baking powder, soda and cinnamon in another bowl. Add the mix to the whisked eggs and sugar. Put the dough to a baking form. Bake it with 170°C about 35 to 40 minutes. It depends on the oven, sometimes it gets ready already after 25 minutes and actually you can’t make anything wrong. Before serving the cake mix the ingredients for the glaze and but it on the cake when it has already cooled down a bit.
